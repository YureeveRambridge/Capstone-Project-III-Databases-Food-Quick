# Capstone-Project-III-Databases-Food-Quick

Porject Spec:

I was asked to create a food delivery system for a company called “Food Quick”.
Food Quick is the company that receives the orders and distributes them to a
driver based on their current load and their location. They want me to create a
program that can help them keep track of the orders and distribute accordingly.

Food Quick stores the following information for each customer:

- Order number
- Customer name
- Contact number of the customer
- Address of the customer
- Location (city) of the customer
- Email address of the customer
- Name of the restaurant
- Location of the restaurant
- Contact number of the restaurant
- How many of each meal is being ordered
- The list of meals being ordered and their prices
- Any special preparation instructions given by the customer
- The total amount to be paid

The information about the drivers is in the text file drivers.txt in the following
format:

John Krill, Cape Town, 4

This shows that the driver’s name is John Krill who is in Durban and he currently
has a load of 4 deliveries.

Food Quick asked me to create an invoice for a customer after the
above information has been inputted into the program. The invoice is a an auto genreated document with the following format:

- Order number 1234
- Customer: Jill Jack
- Email: jilljack@yahoo.com
- Phone number: 123 456 7890
- Location: Cape Town
- You have ordered the following from Aesop’s Pizza in Cape Town:
- 1 x Pepperoni pizza (R78.00)
- 2 x Hawaiian pizza (R82.00)
- Special instructions: Extra tomato base on the Pepperoni pizza
- Total: R242.00
- John Krill is nearest to the restaurant and so he will be delivering your
- order to you at:
- 12 Cherry Road
- Plumstead
- If you need to contact the restaurant, their number is 098 765 4321.
